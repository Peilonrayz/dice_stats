Welcome to dice_stats's documentation!
======================================

If you're new to the library, you may want to have a look at the
:ref:`Tutorial`.

If you want to dive into the library, then you may want to look at
:ref:`Dice Stats`. If that doesn't explain what an object is then you
may want to look at the :ref:`Internal` documentation instead.
